Project on Household Power Consumption
The prediction of global intensity was performed using machine learning for classification and regression. The machine learning models such as random forest classifier, random forest regressor performed satisfactorily reaching at least 99% accuracy for prediction. There are several techniques of forecasting and these techniques provide forecasting models of different accuracy. The accuracy of the prediction is based on the minimum error of the forecast. The random forest model with grid search has been used on the household electricity consumption dataset. It is concluded that random forest model with grid search achieves highest accuracy 99.82% for regression and 99.93% for classification than the other models.
